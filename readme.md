## Realtime Error Reporting API with Pusher

A demo that backs a tutorial on realtime error reporting using Pusher. To get started:

- Clone the project
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/christiannwamba/error-reporting-server
  ```
- Install dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Run
  ```
  npm start
